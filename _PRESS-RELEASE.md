There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Food Truck Finder

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  A one stop shop for food trucks to advertise their menu and current location, and for hungry people to find them.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Food truck finder allows vendors to broadcast their location, menu, and operating hours. Since it's real-time, users who want to find food trucks to eat at can find the closest trucks, and see their menus. In addition, the diners can set up notifications for when their favorite food trucks are open in their neighborhood.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Food trucks have inconsistent operating hours and locations, making it hard for diners to find their favorite trucks. Hungry diners also don't have time to look up on every website to find which truck is nearest.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  By providing one central location for both vendors and diners, Food Truck Finder both drives more business to each participating food truck, as well as allows diners to follow their favorite trucks and find new cuisines to try.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Food Truck Finder strengthens the local economy by empowering small business food truck owners to develop a dedicated fan base, and ensures diners make every meal special."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Food Trucks can register a profile and upload their menu in mere minutes. Then, all they have to do is check in when they arrive at their location. Users can browse without registering, or can register easily using Facebook or Twitter to set up alerts for trucks they love.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  With Food Truck Finder, I've doubled my business in two months! My fans know how to follow where I'll be, and I've met many new friends who said they discovered where my truck would be via this app.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
